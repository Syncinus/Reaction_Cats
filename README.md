# Reaction Cats
<br>
NOTE: REACTION CATS DEVELOPMENT IS CURRENTLY PAUSED!!! <br>
<br>
The Reaction Cats game, short version is RC. <br>
It's a game about cats that battle each other. <br>
The more you battle the more you get. <br>
Read about how it works on its github wiki (which is being worked on).

Hacked together game I made to learn Unity back in 2018 when I was a small kid, the code quality is super inconsistent and is half the reason I abandoned it since by the end I was so much better that I could not maintain the game anymore.
